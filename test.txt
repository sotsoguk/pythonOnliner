Some books deserve to be held aloft and pointed to as an example of factual
correctness. 
These books are valuable resources. 
Other books take liberties with the facts, or present alternate truths. 
This is especially true of books that rely on peopleâ€™s memories with little
corroborating evidence to back it up.
